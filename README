Thanks for jkovacic github user for the FreeRTOS port: https://github.com/jkovacic/FreeRTOS-GCC-tm4c123glx

This project is still in progress. My first aim is to evaluate the Tiva C launchpad with FreeRTOS.
Also, more commits will be provided in the next weeks. Stay tuned.

For using it, you need:
lm4flash: https://github.com/utzig/lm4tools
Make and install it:
cd lm4tools
make
then
sudo cp lm4tools /usr/bin

Compile and load this project:
cd dodow-like
autoreconf -vfi
./configure --host=arm-none-eabi --enable-static CFLAGS="-nostartfiles"
make

then
lm4tools dodow-like.elf.bin

The led blinks with a regular pattern:
 * 4 seconds increasing: Inhale with the nose.
 * 3 seconds rest with 2 glitches: Block the respiration
 * 8 seconds decreasing: Exhale by the mouth.

The software is done to repeat the pattern during 8 minutes.

SW1 change between colors.
SW2 start or stop the pattern.
